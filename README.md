# Pitch_It

"Pitch It!" is a WIP app that currently is being developed in Kotlin by myself, Brandon Muller. 
The goal of the app is to allow student entrepeneurs to be able to test the viability of an product/service with other peers.
User will be able to make accounts and connect with other around the world to see how people react to various pitches, products, or services.
People pitch a product and recieve feedback for their product from other users
